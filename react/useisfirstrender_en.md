### Solution by [Anton Galich](https://github.com/GalichAnton)


### 1. This custom React hook is called useIsFirstRender and it is used to determine whether a component is rendering for the first time or not. It imports necessary function from the React library: useRef. 

### 2. The function useIsFirstRender is declared with no parameters and a return type of boolean. It creates a mutable ref object named isFirst using the useRef hook. The .current property of this ref object is initialized to true.

### 3. The if statement checks whether isFirst.current is true. If it is, then isFirst.current is set to false and the function returns true. This means that the component is rendering for the first time. 

### 4. If isFirst.current is not true, then the function returns isFirst.current (which is false). This means that the component has already rendered at least once before. 


```
import {useRef} from 'react'
export function useIsFirstRender(): boolean {
  // your code here
  const isFirst = useRef(true)

  if (isFirst.current) {
    isFirst.current = false

    return true
  }

  return isFirst.current
}
```

#### Overall, this custom React hook can be used to conditionally render certain components or execute certain logic only on the first render of a component.
