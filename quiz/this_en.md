Problem Statement (Context of this keyword in different situation)
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: function() {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  c() {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  d: () => {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  e: (function() {
    return () => {
      console.log(this.a);
    };
  })(),
  f: function() {
    return () => {
      console.log(this.a);
    };
  }
};

console.log(obj.a); // Output: 1

obj.b(); // Output: 1
;(obj.b)(); // Output: 1
const b = obj.b;
b(); // Output: undefined
obj.b.apply({ a: 2 }); // Output: 2

obj.c(); // Output: 1

obj.d(); // Output: undefined
;(obj.d)(); // Output: undefined
obj.d.apply({ a: 2 }); // Output: undefined

obj.e(); // Output: undefined
;(obj.e)(); // Output: undefined
obj.e.call({ a: 2 }); // Output: undefined

obj.f()(); // Output: 1
;(obj.f())(); // Output: 1
obj.f().call({ a: 2 }); // Output: 1
Explanation of solutions
console.log(obj.a) outputs 1 since it accesses the property a directly from the obj object.

obj.b() outputs 1 because it is a regular function and the this context refers to the object obj.

(obj.b)() is equivalent to obj.b() and also outputs 1 for the same reason.

const b = obj.b; b(); assigns the obj.b function to the variable b, which loses the reference to obj and becomes a regular function. Hence, b() outputs undefined because the this context is no longer obj.

obj.b.apply({ a: 2 }) uses the apply() method to explicitly set the this context to { a: 2 }. As a result, it outputs 2.

obj.c() is a shorthand method syntax and behaves the same as obj.b(). It outputs 1.

obj.d() is an arrow function. Arrow functions have a lexical this context, meaning they inherit this value from their surrounding scope. In this case, the surrounding scope is the global scope, where this.a is undefined. Therefore, obj.d() outputs undefined.

(obj.d)() is equivalent to obj.d() and also outputs undefined due to the same reason mentioned above.

obj.d.apply({ a: 2 }) uses apply() with the arrow function obj.d, but the this context is not affected by apply() for arrow functions. Therefore, it still outputs undefined.

obj.e() is an arrow function defined within an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). Since the IIFE is invoked immediately during object initialization, this refers to the global scope, where this.a is undefined. Thus, obj.e() outputs undefined.

(obj.e)() is equivalent to obj.e() and outputs undefined for the same reason mentioned above.

obj.e.call({ a: 2 }) uses call() with the arrow function obj.e. However, arrow functions do not bind their own this context, so the provided { a: 2 } argument is ignored, and it still outputs undefined.

obj.f()() is a regular function f() that returns an arrow function. It outputs 1 because the inner arrow function inherits the this context from the outer function, which is obj.

(obj.f())() is equivalent to obj.f()() and also outputs 1 for the same reason mentioned above.

obj.f().call({ a: 2 }) calls the returned arrow function from obj.f() with call(), but the arrow function maintains the original this context inherited from obj. Therefore, it still outputs 1.

It's important to note that arrow functions have different behavior for the this context compared to regular functions. They capture the this value from their enclosing scope and do not bind their own this context
