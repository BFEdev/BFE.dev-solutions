## Console Output

The Output is `1`

## React Component Output Explanation

In the given React code snippet, we have a functional component called `App`. Let's break down what the code outputs to the console:

1. `const [state1, setState1] = useState(1);`

   - This line initializes a state variable `state1` with an initial value of `1`.
   - The value of `state1` is logged to the console using `console.log(state1)`.
   - **Output**: `1`

2. `const [state2] = useState(() => { console.log(2); return 2; });`

   - Here, `state2` is initialized using a function as the initial state.
   - The function is executed during the component's initialization phase and logs `2` to the console.
   - However, the value returned by the function (which is `2`) is not used or logged anywhere else.
   - **Output**: `2` (logged during initialization, but not visible in the final output)

3. `useEffect(() => { setState1(3); }, []);`

   - This `useEffect` runs after the initial render because it has an empty dependency array `[]`.
   - Inside the `useEffect`, `setState1(3)` is called, which updates the value of `state1` to `3`.
   - However, this update does not trigger a re-render of the component.
   - As a result, the new value of `state1` (which is `3`) is not logged to the console.
   - **Output**: No additional output is generated.

In summary, the final output in the console is just `1` because only the initial value of `state1` is logged. The log for `state2` (which is `2`) occurs during initialization but is not part of the final output. The update to `state1` within the `useEffect` is not logged since it doesn't trigger a re-render.
