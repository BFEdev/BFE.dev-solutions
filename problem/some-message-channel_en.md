# Explanation of the Code

## Introduction

In this JavaScript code, we utilize the concept of a mixin to enhance the functionality of `SomePort` instances, which are properties of the `SomeChannel` class. We then create a new class called `BetterChannel` that leverages this mixin to add additional methods to these port objects.

## Key Concepts

### Mixins

Mixins are a way to add properties and methods to objects or classes without using inheritance. They allow for the composition of behaviors and can be mixed into any object.

### SomeChannel and SomePort

- `SomeChannel` is a class with two properties: `port1` and `port2`, both of which are instances of `SomePort`.
- `SomePort` has a `postMessage` method and an optional `onmessage` method.

## Code Explanation

### The `portMixin` Object

The `portMixin` object contains methods that we want to add to instances of `SomePort`:

```javascript
const portMixin = {
  postMessage(message, handler) {
    console.log(this.oppositePort);
    if(this.oppositePort.onmessage) {
      this.oppositePort.onmessage(message, this.callingOnceOnly(handler))
    }
  },
  callingOnceOnly(cb) {
    let alreadyCalled = false;
    return function(...args) {
      if(!alreadyCalled){
        cb(...args);
        alreadyCalled = true;
        return;
      }
      else return;
    }
  }
}

1. **`postMessage(message, handler)`**:
   - This method logs the `oppositePort` and checks if the `oppositePort` has an `onmessage` handler.
   - If the `onmessage` handler exists, it calls the handler with the message and ensures the handler is called only once using `callingOnceOnly`.

2. **`callingOnceOnly(cb)`**:
   - This method takes a callback function `cb` and returns a new function that ensures `cb` is called only once.
   - It uses a flag (`alreadyCalled`) to track whether `cb` has been called before.

### Enhancing `SomeChannel` with the Mixin

We then enhance the `SomeChannel` class using the mixin:

```javascript
class BetterChannel {
  constructor() {
    const {port1, port2} = new SomeChannel();
    this.port1 = Object.assign(port1, portMixin, {oppositePort: port2});
    this.port2 = Object.assign(port2, portMixin, {oppositePort: port1});
  }
}
